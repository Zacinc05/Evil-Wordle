open the command line
you can check if you already have python by entering
'python3 --version'.
If you do not, make sure you install a version of python (this can be done many ways,
ex) 'winget install Python.Python.3')

Download the zip fiel and extract, and cd to the directory you placed it in.
Run 'py game' in the command line.

If you run into any issues, make sure a recent version of python is installed, and your command line is in the proper directory 
(use the command 'dir' to make sure the game files are in the same directory)
